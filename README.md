# Tech Assessment: Screenshot diff

This coding exercise, as part of the technical interview, had a 1 hour limit and was one of the unusual tasks ever asked at a coding interview.

The company, that is in business of monitoring employee productivity, tasked me with a _quick-n-dirty_ implementation to monitor screen changes, and, if such changes occur, create a bitmat, whcih highlights the changes, and place the final bitmat image to clipboard.

Platform: Windows 10
Programming language: C++
